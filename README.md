Building Financial Model in Python

A Step-by-step guide on how to build a sturdy discounted cash flow model to calculate NPV, IRR, Payback Period and Multiple Invested Capital (MOIC) using Python.What Is Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model ? How does it help? Discounted cash flow (DCF) models are used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. The cash flows calculated from this model are used by investors, investment bankers, research analysts and companies to make a variety of decisions. Investors may use this model to make new investment decisions, while investment bankers can utilize it to value an asset. Research analysts may prepare this model to give stock recommendations, whereas companies can optimize the model to make efficient capital budgeting and operating expenditure decisions.DCF analysis works on the concept of the time value of money. It can be used in a situation where someone is investing money in the present with expectations of receiving more money in the future. In simple terms, DCF models will help you calculate the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate. If these discounted cash flows over a period of the project are greater than the investment, a person may consider investing their money into the project.
